# QtSssSNibblers
Qt SwissalpS Nibblers is a worm game inspired by NIBBLES.BAS
[https://github.com/tangentstorm/tangentlabs/blob/master/qbasic/NIBBLES.BAS]
and GNOME-Nibbles [https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-nibbles]
The AI is almost identical to that used in GNOME-Nibbles.
The sounds and icons are based on those from the GNOME-Nibbles project.

SwissalpS Nibblers distinguishes itself with:
- Level designer
- More levels possible
- More AI-worms
- More health possible
- Start at any Level
- Two-button steering
- Mouse-button steering *1 player only*
- Setting for Game-Over only when all worms have run out of health
- On every level spawn-points are distributed randomly among worms
- Name worms before game-end
- High score is not defined as there are so many configurables that I resigned to making a sortable table with many columns
- Three modes on encounter of an unplayable level
- AI-worms hug walls less closely
